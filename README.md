# About Me:

I am an IT Specialist working at the intersection of technology, users, and operational processes. I bring hands-on experience from both public sector and private industry environments, where reliability, accuracy, and accountability are critical.

My background covers SaaS platforms, Microsoft environments, system configuration, quality assurance, and technical support in regulated and complex settings. I am particularly strong in roles where software needs to be configured, tested, validated, and delivered correctly — before issues reach the end user.

I am known for a systematic working style, clear documentation, and the ability to translate real-world operational needs into practical technical solutions. I have worked closely with developers, end users, and stakeholders, ensuring that systems behave as agreed and that delivery quality remains high.

While I am not a full-time software developer, I understand modern development practices (CI/CD, automation pipelines, version control) and can communicate effectively with technical teams. This allows me to identify issues early, describe them clearly, and support reliable releases.

I thrive in environments where details matter, routines are essential, and responsibility is real. My motivation is to contribute to stable, secure, and well-functioning systems that support society, services, and people in their daily work.
